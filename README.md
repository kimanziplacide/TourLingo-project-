# This is the project intended to make an app which is a translator. We called it TourLingo
## TourLingo has 4 options in its menu which are:
* 1. translate_text 
* 2. language_quiz 
* 3. user_progress 
* 4. Exit 

Every option has its own function in the class LanguageTranslatorApp. we first downlaoded googletrans to help us to translate the text, then we imported the Tranlator class from the googletrans library.
let us breakdown our code to relate it with our Menu so to have some insights abour our code:
we imported our googletrans library using this code: ''' From googletrans import Translator '''
