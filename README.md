 This is the project intended to make an app which is a translator. We called it TourLingo
# It has 4 options in its menu which are
 **1. translate_text**
## 2. language_quiz
 3. user_progress
 4. Exit

 Every option has its own function in the class LanguageTranslatorApp. we first downlaoded googletrans to help us to translate the text, then we imported the Tranlator class from the googletrans library.
 At the end of our code there is a public instance method called run. This is the main function because it run everything in the class.
